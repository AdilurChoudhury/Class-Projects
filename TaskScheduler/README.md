# Task Scheduler Project

This project simulates the various operating system task scheduling algorithms and creates 10 task control blocks to simulate CPU times, start time, end time, turnaround time, 
and so on.

## Input
When starting up the program, the user will be asked to input a file number to output the file to.

The program then simulates the following:
  - **Start Ticks (Start Time)**
  - **End Ticks (End time)**
  - **Task Number (1 -> 10)**
  - **Task Name (T1 -> T10)**
  - **CPUTime (Total CPU Time)**
  - **Turnaround Time (Total amount of time to complete a task)**

## Output
The program then creates a chart where all of the above items are displayed alongside their values for each task number. Ten tasks are displayed from T1 to T10. The output is
then uploaded to a **.txt** file under **OutputFiles** within the project folder.
